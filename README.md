# contact-via-twitter
===================

A contact form that uses Twitter API so you get fast 140 character messages (the other person doesn't require a twitter account).

People can send you DMs, it is in essence a 140 character contact form. You setup by editing config.php. Simply enter your twitter username, upload it to your server and users can send you DMs even if they don't have a twitter account.

Note: I don't reccomend you use this, as it requires your password. Anyone can request a pull and implent the OAuth.
